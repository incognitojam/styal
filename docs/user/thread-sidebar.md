# Working with threads

Use a new thread for a separate task. New threads start in a new worktree, with
their own branch and working directory. To work in the project's checkout instead,
change the thread's workspace mode before sending, or change the default in
**Settings → General → New threads**.

## Start a thread

On web and desktop, a new thread keeps the current project and carries your model
and mode selections, unless the destination project has its own model default.
Its branch and workspace mode come from your configured defaults. To continue in
an existing worktree, use **New thread in this worktree** from the branch toolbar.

When you change a new thread's project, T3 Code stays in the current environment
if that project exists there. Otherwise it selects an environment that has it.

### Start in the background

In a desktop browser or the desktop app, press `Cmd+Enter` on macOS or `Ctrl+Enter`
on Windows and Linux to start a new thread and immediately open another draft. The
next draft keeps the workspace mode and base branch you selected. With **New
worktree**, each background submission creates its own worktree.

## Pin and reorder threads

Pin a thread from its menu to keep it above your active work. Drag pinned threads
to reorder them on web and desktop, or use **Move up** and **Move down** on mobile.
The order syncs across devices.

Unpinning asks for confirmation by default. Turn this off in **Settings → General →
Unpin confirmation**; the preference is saved separately on each device.

Pinning does not prevent automatic settlement. Settling a thread removes its pin.

## Filter by project

Use the menu below the sidebar search to show a single project. While a project is
selected, **New thread** creates the thread there without asking. The **new thread
in current project** shortcut uses the open thread's project, or the selected
project when no thread is open. Choose **All projects** to clear the filter.

## Settle finished work

Choose **Settle thread** from its menu to move finished work out of the active list
without deleting the conversation. **Un-settle thread** restores it to active work
and prevents automatic settlement until new activity resumes the usual rules.

By default, environments settle inactive threads after three days and settle
threads whose pull request merged. A closed pull request can also settle an idle
thread. Work in progress, pending questions or approvals, and live background work
prevent automatic settlement. An open pull request does not prevent inactivity
settlement, but an old closed or merged pull request does not settle work you
resumed after it closed.

Change these rules in **Settings → General**. They continue to run when your apps
are closed. Changes apply to connected environments that support shared settings;
offline environments and older servers keep their previous values. If connected
environments disagree, **Apply to all** copies your current settings to those named
in the warning. Changing a rule does not reopen already settled threads.

## Link a pull request

The server finds the PR for each unsettled thread's saved branch, even when your
apps are closed. Settled threads keep their saved links. Update the server if
automatic branch links do not appear.

On web and desktop, right-click a pull request link in a thread and choose
**Link to thread** to select a different PR. Use **Unlink from thread** on the
same link to return to the branch PR, if one exists.
The linked pull request participates in automatic settlement.

## Find and reference work

On web and desktop, open the command palette with `Cmd/Ctrl+K` to search threads
across connected environments. Message search starts after two characters and
includes your messages and final agent responses.

Use **Settings → Keybindings** to find or customize shortcuts for searching files
and copying a thread reference. A copied reference uses the thread's pull request
link when available, otherwise its thread ID. See [keybindings](./keybindings.md)
for custom configuration.

## Copying a transcript

On web and desktop, choose **Copy → Transcript** from a thread's menu to copy its
user and assistant messages as Markdown under the thread title. Tool activity and
replies that are still streaming are left out. The transcript includes history that
is not currently loaded.

## Inspect agent work

On web and desktop, use **Agents** to follow work delegated to subagents.

Expand a tool call in the conversation to see its full command and output.
Summaries shorten shell wrappers and can still describe the latest call after it
finishes; the call's own result shows its status.

## Completion sounds

On web and desktop, choose a **Completion sound** in **Settings → General** to hear
when an agent finishes or asks for input: **Resolve**, **Avanti**, or none. A thread
waiting for your input shows **Awaiting Input** until you answer.
