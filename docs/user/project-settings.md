# Settings and project overrides

On web and desktop, the "Applying settings for …" sentence at the top of Settings pages picks
the project and environment a change applies to. Pages that only hold device preferences, such as
Appearance, don't show it. Integrations lists every environment explicitly and has no scope filters.
The filters start at **All projects** and **All environments**
and stay selected as you move between categories or search for a setting.

Preferences saved on this device, such as appearance, confirmations and browser profiles, always
show and ignore the selection. Everything else is stored on a server. Choose one environment to
edit its settings, or leave **All environments** to edit every connected environment at once.
Offline environments keep their current values; this is a bulk edit, not a synced global default.

Choose a project to override settings for it on the selected environments. A layers icon beside
each server row's title shows where the value comes from: the built-in default, the environment,
or a project override. Click it to see that chain on every selected environment. An override can
be reset to inherit again. Settings that cannot be overridden by a project are shown read-only
while a project is selected.

When the selected environments disagree, the control shows **Mixed** in place of a value and the
layers icon turns amber. Picking a value applies it to every selected environment.

Changing an environment value never touches a project's own override. When projects override the
setting you are editing, the layers icon counts them and the chain lists each one with its value:
click a project to jump to it, or **Reset all** to make those projects follow the environment
again.

Providers and diagnostics are per machine: they show one environment at a time, the primary
one until you pick another. Integrations shows each environment's setup and changes only the
environment whose controls you use. Other server settings fan out to the selection.

With a project selected, a provider's switch in **Settings → Providers** turns it on or off for
that project only, in either direction: a provider off on the machine can be used in one project,
and one on everywhere can be kept out of another. That project's model pickers follow the switch,
and no new turn there can start on a provider it turned off, including queued messages and
follow-ups from delegated tasks. A turn already running when the switch flips finishes. A delegated
task's result still lands in its parent thread, which sees it on its next turn. Reset returns the project to the
machine's setting. Every other provider setting stays per machine.

On mobile, open **Settings** and use the filter in its header to choose connected environments
and a project. The filter stays available in server-setting pages. With **All projects** selected,
the **Server settings** categories and auto-settle controls in **Thread behavior** edit the
selected environments' defaults. Choosing a project edits its overrides on the selected
environments. Use **Use defaults** in a page to remove that page's project overrides.
Open **Settings → Projects & threads → Overview** to rename the project across its selected
connected checkouts and see where those checkouts live.
Settings that are environment-wide stay read-only while a project is selected. When selected
targets disagree, a control shows **Mixed** until you choose one value. Appearance, keyboard,
and other phone-only settings ignore the filter.

## Worktree branch names

In **Settings → Source Control → Worktree branch naming**, choose a static prefix,
a model-selected semantic prefix such as `feat/` or `fix/`, or custom instructions
for the complete name. The static prefix defaults to `styal/`; a trailing slash is
optional, and an empty prefix adds nothing. Invalid characters in a static prefix
are replaced with hyphens. Custom instructions are appended to
the naming prompt and can specify issue IDs, namespaces, and casing.

These settings apply to automatically named new worktree branches. Select a project
to override its environment defaults. Worktree directories keep their original names.
If generation fails, or a custom name is invalid or already taken, the temporary
branch name remains.

## Scheduled tasks on mobile

Open **Settings → Scheduled tasks** to create recurring tasks or manage existing
ones across your connected environments. Use the settings filter to narrow the
list by environment or project. Each task runs on the environment you choose,
using its project, model, and workspace settings. Fixed-time schedules use that
environment's time zone, which may differ from your phone's.

Deleting a thread also deletes tasks that post into that thread. Tasks that start
a new thread on each run survive deletion of their previous threads.

You can edit, pause, resume, run immediately, or delete a task from the list.
Webhook tasks only run when their URL is called, so they can't be run
immediately.
Leaving an edited form asks before discarding unsaved changes.

## Webhook automations

In **Settings → Scheduled tasks**, choose **On webhook**
as a task's schedule to run it whenever another service calls its URL, such as
GitHub on a new pull request or a CI job that failed. A public URL needs a
[T3 Connect](remote-access.md) managed tunnel; after you save the task, copy
its URL from the editor. Without one, the editor shows only the URL's path.
**Rotate** replaces the URL and the old one stops working.

The prompt decides what the agent sees. Placeholders pull values out of the
request: `{{body.path}}` for a JSON or form field, `{{headers.name}}`,
`{{query.name}}`, `{{body}}` for the raw body, and `{{request}}` for everything.
For example, `Review this PR: {{body.pull_request.html_url}}` sends only the
pull request link. A placeholder with no value is left empty.

Each value reaches the agent wrapped in `<webhook-data-…>` tags and marked as
untrusted request data. This helps the agent tell it apart from your
instructions, but it doesn't guarantee the agent ignores what the text says.
Inside a value, every `$`, other currency sign and `@`, and a `/` that starts
a lone word, gets an invisible character after it, so mentions like `$skill`,
`@file` and `/command` don't act. Text copied from a value, such as an email
address or a command, carries that character too. Without a signature, anyone
with the URL can start a run with any content. A signature only proves which
service sent the request: a GitHub payload still carries text written by any
GitHub user.

For GitHub, turn on **Require signature**, keep the header
`x-hub-signature-256`, hex encoding and the `sha256=` prefix, and enter the
same secret in the repository's webhook settings with content type
`application/json`. Requests without a valid signature are rejected. Set this
up on desktop or web; mobile keeps an existing signature check but can't turn
one on.

To run only for some requests, add **Filters**. Each one tests a value named
like a placeholder, without the braces, such as `headers.x-github-event` equals
`pull_request` or `body.action` is one of `opened, reopened`. A task runs only
when every filter matches; other requests are answered normally, logged as
**Filtered** with the first filter that failed, and start nothing. Values
compare as text, and a value that is an object or a list only passes
**exists**. Separate **is one of** values with commas; a value can't contain
a comma or start or end with a space.

On desktop and web, pick **Deliveries** from a task's menu to see recent
requests and the prompt each one produced.

If the environment is offline, the sender gets an error and nothing runs;
redeliver from the sender, such as GitHub's **Recent Deliveries**, once it is
back. To have T3 Connect keep requests instead, turn on **Hold webhooks while
offline** in **Settings → Connections**. T3 Connect then stores requests to a
T3 Connect URL for up to 24 hours and delivers them when the environment
returns. Leave it off if you don't want request bodies stored outside your
machine. To skip requests that waited too long, set **Skip requests older
than** on the task.

## Defaults and inheritance

General contains the model and workspace for new threads. Integrations controls browser and device
access separately for each environment; its browser preferences apply to this client. Source Control
contains automatic pull, the default pull request merge method and text generation. General and
Source Control edit environment defaults or project overrides depending on the project crumb.

To override browser or device access for a project, select it in **Settings → Projects** and use
**Agent access**; its simulator memory mode is under **Devices**. Reset an override to follow the environment again. Existing overrides keep their values.

The Project category, shown while a project is selected, holds the project's name, icon,
additional instructions, actions, checkouts and removal. Actions belong to a project: editing them
creates the project's own list on each selected environment, and reset returns to the
environment's shared list. A project's `t3.json` actions can be reviewed and imported there.

Settings a repository can also declare in its project file, such as the workspace for new threads,
resolve in one order: a project override, then the environment setting, then the project file, then
the built-in default. Leave a setting on **Inherit** to let the next tier decide.

The project file is `styal.json` at the repository root. A repository that still has only a
`t3.json` from T3 Code keeps working: its settings and icon apply until it gains a `styal.json`,
after which `t3.json` is ignored entirely, even if `styal.json` cannot be read.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://styal.build/schema/styal.json",
  "iconPath": "assets/logo.svg",
  "defaultThreadEnvMode": "worktree",
  "worktreeSubmodules": "top-level"
}
```

The `$schema` entry is optional, but enables validation and suggestions in editors that support
JSON Schema. styal also accepts comments and trailing commas in this file. It keeps reading valid
settings when another value fails validation, and **Settings** → **Projects** shows a warning when
any part of the file is ignored.
Browser access changes apply when an agent session next starts.

New worktrees initialize git submodules recursively. If that step is slow because the repository
declares many nested submodules, set **Submodules** in **Settings → General** (with the project
selected to override it there) to **Top level only** to stop at the ones the repository declares
itself, or **Skip** to leave them for a setup script. It resolves in the same order as the
workspace default: a `"worktreeSubmodules"` value in the project file of the branch being checked
out applies when the project and environment are both on **Inherit**.

## Worktree location

New worktrees go in the `worktrees` folder of the T3 home directory. To put them somewhere else,
such as another drive, set **Settings → Storage → Worktree location** to an absolute path like
`D:\worktrees` or `~/worktrees`. The setting is per machine. Existing worktrees stay where they
are, and cleanup covers both the default folder and the custom one.

## Storage cleanup

Open **Settings → Storage** to enable automatic cleanup on one machine or all connected
environments. Policies are off by default and run on the server at startup, when changed, and
hourly. Offline machines keep their existing policies.

Select a project to set **Automatic worktree cleanup** to **Inherit**, **Off**, or **Custom**.
Inherit follows each machine's rules; Off keeps that project's worktrees until you remove them
manually. Custom applies separate worktree rules to the selected project or checkout. Browser
captures and log retention remain machine-wide.

Worktrees can be removed after a chosen number of inactive days, after a thread settles, after
merging, or when they have no commits beyond the default branch. Set settled retention to 0 days
to remove a worktree at the next cleanup after settlement. Only T3-managed worktrees are eligible.
Active sessions and shared worktrees prevent removal. **Keep worktrees with local changes** defaults
to **Uncommitted changes**, which protects tracked edits and untracked files but deletes ignored
files such as `.env` and build output. **Any local files** also protects ignored files other than
`node_modules`. **Edited tracked files** protects only tracked edits and allows untracked and
ignored files to be deleted. Branches and thread history stay; starting another turn recreates the checkout.
Merge cleanup requires a merged pull request whose commits are included in the remote default
branch. A squash or rebase merge on GitHub also counts when the pull request targeted the default
branch and the worktree is still at the pull request's last commit.

Enable **Delete worktrees with deleted threads** to remove safe worktrees after their last
thread is deleted, including archived threads and worktrees left by earlier deletions. The
server waits for sessions and terminals to stop and retries skipped worktrees after restart.
Existing prompts for deleting a worktree manually remain available when this policy is off.

Choose **Delete now** to run the enabled rules immediately. The latest results show which
worktrees were removed or kept and why, plus any failures.
Results also list folders in the worktree folder that no thread uses, with their sizes; cleanup never removes them, so remove them manually if you want.

Browser captures and rotated logs have separate retention periods. Expired capture links stop
working. Current logs, message attachments, and browser profiles are kept.

## Pin and archive projects

**Settings → Projects** lists every project on every connected machine. Pin the ones you use
most: pinned projects come first in every project picker, in the order you drag them to. You can
also pin from the sidebar's project filter, with **Pin project** in the command palette
(`Cmd/Ctrl+K`), or, with [threads grouped by project](./thread-sidebar.md#group-threads-by-project),
by dragging a project's header.

Archive a project you are done with. It leaves the project pickers, its threads leave the
sidebar and the command palette, and its pull requests leave the **Pull requests** page. Nothing is deleted, and threads keep their state. Find it under
**Archived** in **Settings → Projects** and choose **Unarchive** to bring everything back.

Pin and archive apply to the project on every machine, so every machine with the project must
be connected. On mobile, use **Organize** in **Settings → Projects & threads → Overview**.

## Project icons

Select the project and open Projects to choose an icon, emoji, monogram, or image. The choice applies to
every checkout in the project group and appears on connected clients. Choose **Automatic** to let
T3 Code detect an icon again.

Choose **Monogram** in the icon picker to set one or two letters or numbers and a color.

When no image is found, web and desktop show a two-character monogram with a color
from the icon palette, derived from the saved project name. For example, `Nebula` becomes `NA`,
`Silver Orchard` becomes `SO`, and `M7 Forge` becomes `M7`.

## Give agents project instructions

Use **Additional instructions** to provide guidance whenever T3 Code starts an agent session for
the project. The instructions apply to every checkout in the project group and work with Codex,
Claude, Cursor, Grok, and OpenCode. Clear the field or reset it to stop including them in future
sessions.

## Keep the default branch current

In Source Control, enable **Automatically pull** to keep the default-branch checkout up to date
with its configured upstream. Choose an environment to set the default or a project to override it.
On mobile, use **Settings → Source control** to change selected environment defaults or project overrides.

T3 Code only pulls when it can fast-forward and the checkout has no changed files, untracked files,
or local commits. It skips checkouts on another branch or without an upstream. If a checkout has
local work, resolve it yourself before automatic pulls can resume.

## Stable workspace ports

Every workspace receives a persistent range of ten development ports; there is no setting to
enable. Agents, terminals, and project scripts launched locally for the workspace receive the first
port as `STYAL_WORKSPACE_PORT`, and the range continues with the next nine numbers. A worktree
keeps its range across restarts, and local threads share the range of the project's main checkout.

For example, a project script can run `npm run dev -- --port "$STYAL_WORKSPACE_PORT"` and give a
second service `$((STYAL_WORKSPACE_PORT + 1))`. Workspaces in the same environment never receive
overlapping ranges, but unrelated programs on the machine can still listen on those ports.

See [Project scripts](./project-scripts.md) for the script format and other project environment
variables.
